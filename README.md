# CSS-Styleguide

All of the content in this repository lives in the [Wiki](https://github.com/OrchidAugur/CSS-Styleguide/wiki).

This styleguide outlines sensible rules to follow in order to maintain a clean, easy to understand stylesheet. The use of SCSS is assumed, but the underlying philosophy should be applicable to raw CSS or other preprocessors.

Obviously, these rules are subjective, as with any styleguide- so feel free to use them as-is, modify them, or ignore them completely according to your own preferences.

I'd love to hear if anyone uses these guidelines, as they are or modified, as well as any feedback- especially if there's stuff I've failed to account for!
